                MAR has been organizing small ocean wildlife expeditions for 12 years. We keep our groups small to minimize our impact on the areas we visit and to ensure the animals are not stressed or overwhelmed. This also ensures that our guests can maximize time with the animals. Our company is a tight knit group of conservationists and experts in their fields. All of our employees are passionate about wildlife and conservation. We are all marine biologists and ocean aficionados, so we can give you lots of information, and believe me, we have a lot to share. We consider each other 'Ohana': a Hawaiian term meaning "family". By the end of your journey you will be part of the MAR Ohana. Meet the team
